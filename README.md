# django-basic-app

I created this small application to understand the python web framework django. This is a simple web application that let user choose from different questionnaires and ask multiple questions related to the questionnaire. Send back response after each response and get the next question based on the response.
It helped me understand the basics of Django, CORS issues, AJAX calls and problem solving in general.
